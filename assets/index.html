    <p>What is analysis?
        This text is an honours-level undergraduate introduction to real analysis:<br> the analysis of the real numbers, sequences and series of real num
       bers, and real-valued functions. This is related to, but is distinct from,
        complex analysis, which concerns the analysis of the complex numbers
        and complex functions, harmonic analysis, which concerns the analy
       sis of harmonics (waves) such as sine waves, and how they synthesize
        other functions via the Fourier transform, functional analysis, which fo
       cuses much more heavily on functions (and how they form things like
        vector spaces), and so forth. Analysis is the rigorous study of such
        objects, with a focus on trying to pin down precisely and accurately
        the qualitative and quantitative behavior of these objects. Real analy
       sis is the theoretical foundation which underlies calculus,whichis the
        collection of computational algorithms which one uses to manipulate
        functions.

            This text is intended for honours-level undergraduate students
            in mathematics, or for graduate students in other areas of
            mathematics who need a review of the basics of real analysis.

            A good background in proofs and mathematical reasoning is
            assumed; this text is not suitable for students who have not
            had a course in proofs.

   <section class="main-sec"><h1>Starting at the beginning: the natural numbers</h1>
   <p> In this text, we will review the material you have learnt in high school
    and in elementary calculus classes, but as rigorously as possible. To do
    so we will have to begin at the very basics- indeed, we will go back to the
    concept of numbers and what their properties are. Of course, you have
    dealt with numbers for over ten years and you know how to manipulate
    the rules of algebra to simplify any expression involving numbers, but
    we will now turn to a more fundamental issue, which is: why do the rules
    of algebra work at all? For instance, why is it true that a(b+c)isequal
    to ab+ac for any three numbers a,b,c? This is not an arbitrary choice
    of rule; it can be proven from more primitive, and more fundamental,
    properties of the number system. This will teach you a new skill- how
    to prove complicated properties from simpler ones. You will find that
    even though a statement may be “obvious”, it may not be easy to prove;
    the material here will give you plenty of practice in doing so, and in the
    process will lead you to think about why an obvious statement really is
    obvious. One skill in particular that you will pick up here is the use of
    mathematical induction, which is a basic tool in proving things in many
    areas of mathematics.</p>

   <section class="main-sec"><h1>Set theory</h1>
    <p>Modern analysis, like most of modern mathematics, is concerned with
    numbers, sets, and geometry. We have already introduced one type
    of number system, the natural numbers. We will introduce the other
    number systems shortly, but for now we pause to introduce the concepts
    and notation of set theory, as they will be used increasingly heavily in
    later chapters. (We will not pursue a rigorous description of Euclidean
    geometry in this text, preferring instead to describe that geometry in
    terms of the real number system by means of the Cartesian co-ordinate
    system.)
    While set theory is not the main focus of this text, almost every other
    branch of mathematics relies on set theory as part of its foundation, so
    it is important to get at least some grounding in set theory before doing
    other advanced areas of mathematics. In this chapter we present the
    more elementary aspects of axiomatic set theory, leaving more advanced
    topics such as a discussion of infinite sets and the axiom of choice to
    Chapter 8. A full treatment of the finer subtleties of set theory (of
    which there are many!) is unfortunately well beyond the scope of this
    text.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A set is a collection of objects, called the elements of the
            set. For instance, the set {1,2,3} is the collection of three
            objects, 1, 2, and 3. The order in which the elements are
            listed does not matter; {3,2,1} is the same set as {1,2,3}.
        </li>
        <li>
            The notation x ∈ A means that x is an element of the set A.
            For instance, 2 ∈ {1,2,3}, but 4 ∉ {1,2,3}.
        </li>
    </ul>

   <section class="main-sec"><h1>Integrals and rationals</h1>
    <p>In Chapter 2 we built up most of the basic properties of the natural
    number system, but we have reached the limits of what one can do with
    just addition and multiplication. We would now like to introduce a new
    operation, that of subtraction, but to do that properly we will have to
    pass from the natural number system to a larger number system, that
    of the integers.
    Informally, the integers are what you can get by subtracting two
    natural numbers; for instance, 3 − 5 should be an integer, as should
    6 −2. This is not a complete definition of the integers, because (a) it
    doesn’t say when two differences are equal (for instance we should know
    why 3−5 is equal to 2−4, but is not equal to 1−6), and (b) it doesn’t
    say how to do arithmetic on these differences (how does one add 3 − 5
    to 6−2?). Furthermore, (c) this definition is circular because it requires
    a notion of subtraction, which we can only adequately define once the
    integers are constructed. Fortunately, because of our prior experience
    with integers we know what the answers to these questions should be.
    To answer (a), we know from our advanced knowledge in algebra that
    a−b =c−dhappens exactly when a+d = c+b, so we can characterize
    equality of differences using only the concept of addition. Similarly, to
    answer (b) we know from algebra that (a−b)+(c−d)=(a+c)−(b+d)
    and that (a−b)(c−d)=(ac+bd)−(ad+bc). So we will take advantage of
    our foreknowledge by building all this into the definition of the integers,
    as we shall do shortly.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero.
            The set of integers is denoted by the symbol Z, which comes from
        </li>
        <li>
            the German word "Zahlen," meaning "numbers." The set of integers
            includes {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.
