         What is analysis?
         This text is an honours-level undergraduate introduction to real analysis: the analysis of the real numbers, sequences and series of real num
         bers, and real-valued functions. This is related to, but is distinct from,
         complex analysis, which concerns the analysis of the complex numbers
         and complex functions, harmonic analysis, which concerns the analy
         sis of harmonics (waves) such as sine waves, and how they synthesize
         other functions via the Fourier transform, functional analysis, which fo
         cuses much more heavily on functions (and how they form things like
         vector spaces), and so forth. Analysis is the rigorous study of such
         objects, with a focus on trying to pin down precisely and accurately
         the qualitative and quantitative behavior of these objects. Real analy
         sis is the theoretical foundation which underlies calculus,whichis the
         collection of computational algorithms which one uses to manipulate
         functions.

            This text is intended for honours-level undergraduate students
            in mathematics, or for graduate students in other areas of
            mathematics who need a review of the basics of real analysis.

            A good background in proofs and mathematical reasoning is
            assumed; this text is not suitable for students who have not
            had a course in proofs.

          In this text, we will review the material you have learnt in high school
          and in elementary calculus classes, but as rigorously as possible. To do
          so we will have to begin at the very basics- indeed, we will go back to the
          concept of numbers and what their properties are. Of course, you have
          dealt with numbers for over ten years and you know how to manipulate
          the rules of algebra to simplify any expression involving numbers, but
          we will now turn to a more fundamental issue, which is: why do the rules
          of algebra work at all?
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          For instance, why is it true that a(b+c)isequal
          to ab+ac for any three numbers a,b,c? This is not an arbitrary choice
          of rule; it can be proven from more primitive, and more fundamental,
          properties of the number system. This will teach you a new skill- how
          to prove complicated properties from simpler ones. You will find that
          even though a statement may be “obvious”, it may not be easy to prove;
          the material here will give you plenty of practice in doing so, and in the
          process will lead you to think about why an obvious statement really is
          obvious. One skill in particular that you will pick up here is the use of
          mathematical induction, which is a basic tool in proving things in many
          areas of mathematics.

       <p>
         Modern analysis, like most of modern mathematics, is concerned with numbers,
         sets, and geometry. Before advancing further, we introduce the basic concepts
         and notation of set theory. Almost every branch of mathematics relies on set
         theory as part of its foundation.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A set is a collection of objects, called the elements of the
            set. For instance, the set {1,2,3} is the collection of three
            objects, 1, 2, and 3. The order in which the elements are
            listed does not matter; {3,2,1} is the same set as {1,2,3}.
          </li>
          <li>
            The notation <em>x ∈ A</em> means that <em>x</em> is an element of the set <em>A</em>.
            For example, 2 ∈ {1,2,3}, but 4 ∉ {1,2,3}.

          We have reached the limits of what can be done with just addition and multiplication.
          To introduce subtraction properly, we must move from the natural number system to
          the integers — whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero.
            The set of integers is denoted by the symbol Z, which comes from
          </li>
          <li>
            the German word "Zahlen," meaning "numbers." The set of integers
            includes {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.
